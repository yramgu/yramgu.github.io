Correlation is one of the main tools in DSP. Mathematically speaking, the (discrete)
correlation between two signals :math:`x` and :math:`h` is given by:

.. math::

    x_{corr}[n] = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{m=+\infty} x[m] h[m-n]

where :math:`n` represents a time delay. It looks very similar to convolution,
but it's ultimately not the same thing. What correlation between two signals does
is essentially 'measuring' how much the signals are similar to each other. The more 
similarities, the higher the correlation output. This is very
useful for a number of things, and I will show a few pratical examples below.

Matched filtering
===========================

Matched fitering is the process of correlating an unknown signal with a reference
waveform. It is the optimal filter which allows maximizing the SNR in presence of AWGN noise.
The reference waveform should be chosen to match a typical pattern or pulse shape 
that we are expecting in the incoming signal. If we define that expected pulse by a function :math:`p(t)`
and our matched filter impulse response a function :math:`h(t)`, then it turns out the 
optimal :math:`h(t)` would be the time-flipped conjugate version of :math:`p(t)`, or:

.. math::

    h(t) = p^{*}(-t)


Let's take the most simple example: if we consider a simple binary stream of data,
the reference waveform would be a pulse of width equal to a single bit.
This waveform is the famous rectangular function, defined by:

.. math::

    p(t) = rect(t) = \Pi(t) = \Biggl\lbrace
    ^{{\displaystyle 1 \text{, if } \biggl\lvert\frac{t-t_{0}}{T}\biggl\rvert < \frac{1}{2}}}
    _{\displaystyle{0 \text{, elsewhere }}}

with :math:`t_{0}` the center position of the pulse (i.e. its delay) and :math:`T` the pulse width.
The autocorrelation of this function is a triangular pulse:

Now let's try with a real OOK-modulated signal recorded with the RTL-SDR:

**Top graph**: we plot the signal enveloppe. Then we define a reference pulse
equivalent to one bit, and we correlate it with the recorded signal.
