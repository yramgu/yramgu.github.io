Who am I?
==========

An RF/Hardware engineer, and a home tinkerer. 
While I'm  not a professional coder or a DSP engineer, I took an interest in SDR 
(Software Defined Radio) and radio signal processing as a hobby after discovering the very cheap RTL-SDR.

What will you find here?
========================

This website is a collection of articles related to practical radio engineering, focused on SDR 
and simple experiments I made using Python. It's not meant to provide mathematical rigour, but rather
illustrate concepts in a practical way. All the scripts used for these articles are provided so that you can run them 
yourself and experiment.
