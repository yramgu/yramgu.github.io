Who am I?
==========

An Analog/Hardware RF engineer -though I don't do much design myself anymore-
, and a home tinkerer. 
Even if I'm not a professional coder or a DSP engineer, I took an interest in SDR 
(Software Defined Radio) and radio signal processing. When I discovered the RTL-SDR and how cheap it is
I went down the rabbit hole. Since I only need an SDR dongle and my laptop to play,
it has the added bonus of taking waaaaay less space in the living room than my usual electronics bench.

What will you find here?
========================

This website is a collection of articles related to practical radio engineering, focused on SDR 
and experiments I made with the RTL-SDR. All my code is in Python as I find this language perfect
for learning and applying radio dsp concepts, thanks to its fantastic libraires such as Numpy, Scipy 
and the likes.
